## a tool for tracking progress on leetcode
#### by Auden Woolfson

This is script in python for scraping the popular website leetcode and updating an excel spreadsheet with information on a specific problem. It requires the URL of the desired problem and the filepath to the excel spreadsheet the user wants to update.

The spreadsheet used must be formatted in a specific way. Here is a table that illustrates that formatting:

|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| |Name|Difficulty|Related Topics|Solution|Notes|URL|
